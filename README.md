Artimental
=============
A sentiment analysis for compelling imagery. As an artist it is difficult to tell what images you've created are most appealing to an audience. As a viewer of art it is difficult to know what you like. The Art Sentiment project reveals what visuals have the most sentiment or emotional value to viewers. The artist also learns what imagery has the most impact on his audience.

In the persistent version, each painting has its own Sentiment Score. A Featured image is displayed on the side to compare to the actual taste of the viewer.
